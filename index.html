                        My name is Trevor Blanchard.  Growing up I have always loved math.  I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with math
                        so I looked in to Computer Science.  I ended up falling in love with it and decided to go major in Computer 
                        Science.  I ended up going to Merrimack College in North Andover, MA.  I graduated in 2021 with a major in 
                        Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.

                        My biggest problem was growing up, was my speech.  I was in a special class when I was really young to help me 
                        with my speech problems.  I ended up testing out of it by the end of second grade.  I have always had a problem 
                        with spelling as well, which makes spell check my best friend.
